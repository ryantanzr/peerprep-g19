# User Service Guide

## Setting-up

> 📝 Note: If you are familiar with MongoDB and wish to use a local instance, please feel free to do so via the **[MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)**. This guide utilizes MongoDB Cloud Services.
>
> ⚠️ Important Network Notice: MongoDB Atlas connections are blocked on the NUS network. If you are using MongoDB Atlas, you must disconnect from the NUS network (including NUS Wi-Fi or nVPN) and connect using an alternative network such as phone hotspot. Otherwise, your application will fail to connect to the database even if your connection string is correct.

1. Set up a MongoDB Cluster by following the steps in this **[guide](./MongoDBSetup.md)**.

2. After setting up, go to the **[Clusters](https://cloud.mongodb.com/go?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.mongodb.com%2Fv2%2F%3Cproject%3E%23%2Fclusters)**  Page. You would see a list of the clusters you have set up. Select `Connect` on the cluster you just created earlier on for User Service.

3. Select the `Drivers` option, as we have to link to a Node.js App (User Service).

    ![alt text](./GuideAssets/DriverSelection.png)

4. Select `Node.js` in the **Driver** dropdown menu.
5. Copy the connection string.

    > Note, you may see `<password>` in this connection string. We will be replacing this with the admin account password that we created earlier on when setting up the Cluster.

    ![alt text](./GuideAssets/ConnectionString.png)

6. In the `user-service` directory, create a copy of the `.env.sample` file and name it `.env`.

7. Update the `DB_CLOUD_URI` of the `.env` file, and paste the string we copied earlier in **step 5**. Also remember to replace the `<db_password>` placeholder with the **actual password**.

> ⚠️ Warning: If the password contains special characters, make sure to URL-encode them before placing them in the connection string. For example, if your password is `P@ssword`, you should replace `@` with `%40`, resulting in `P%40ssword`.

## Running User Service

> 📝 Note: Ensure you have **[Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download)** installed. At the time of writing, the latest LTS version is `v24.13.0`. Select your operating system, package manager, and Node.js version from the dropdowns at the top of the [page]((https://nodejs.org/en/download)), then follow the provided instructions.

1. Open Command Line/Terminal and navigate into the `user-service` directory.

    ```sh
    cd user-service
    ```

2. Install all the necessary dependencies by running the command:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the User Service in production mode by running:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    Alternatively, you can start it up in development mode (which includes features like automatic server restart when you make code changes) by running:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the User Service on port `3001`. If you wish to change this, please update `PORT` in the `.env` file.

### Get User

- This endpoint allows retrieval of a single user's data from the database using the user's ID.

  > 💡 The user ID refers to the MongoDB Object ID, a unique identifier automatically generated by MongoDB for each document in a collection.

- HTTP Method: `GET`

- Endpoint: <http://localhost:3001/users/{userId}>

- Parameters
  - Required: `userId` path parameter
  - Example: `http://localhost:3001/users/60c72b2f9b1d4c3a2e5f8b4c`

- Headers

  - Required: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN>`

  - Explanation: This endpoint requires the client to include a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the HTTP request header for authentication and authorization. This token is generated during the authentication process (i.e., login) and contains information about the user's identity. The server verifies this token to ensure that the client is authorized to access the data.

  - Auth Rules:

    - Admin users: Can retrieve any user's data. The server verifies the user associated with the JWT token is an admin user and allows access to the requested user's data.

    - Non-admin users: Can only retrieve their own data. The server checks if the user ID in the request URL matches the ID of the user associated with the JWT token. If it matches, the server returns the user's own data.

- Responses:

    |-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | 200 (OK)                    | Success, user data returned                              |
    | 401 (Unauthorized)          | Access denied due to missing/invalid/expired JWT         |
    | 403 (Forbidden)             | Access denied for non-admin users accessing others' data |
    | 404 (Not Found)             | User with the specified ID not found                     |
    | 500 (Internal Server Error) | Database or server error                                 |
